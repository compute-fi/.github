DISCLAIMER: This is an ongoing project. Not all features are ready yet. There is a difference between the idea we want to build and what we have already build.

# What is 'yield to compute'!

The Project aims to create a decentralized funding mechanism for Ai inference where users or entire communities can operate open source AI models by using yield generated from their staked capital. The yield is transformed from monetary energy to computational energy in a verifiable, automated manner. The user stakes capital and manages the Ai. 


## How It Works
- Users store their capital in a yield-bearing product. For example: stEth or a stablecoin. The yield gets collected periodically from our vault.
- A smart contract automatically converts the yield generated into compute. Stakers get a compute balance for their yield.
- The compute balance is then available to buy compute on a peer-to-peer decentralized network.
- Compute can be applied on a model for inference.


## Core Components

### Yield-Generating Protocol:
Users deposit capital into yield-bearing products offered by our protocol leveraging defi protocols.

### Asset Conversion: 
The generated yield is converted into an asset to pay for the Ai inference. By paying for the api use or by buying compute on a decentralized network to run open source models. A decentralized compute provider should be ideal here?

### Tokenized Ai: 
Token bound accounts for nft’s can be used to access: the staked funds, the compute balance and the Ai model.

### Community Access Control:
A community may foster its own Ai, privately. The Ai can be tuned to the core values and needs of that community. On chain governance can be introduced.
An nft can function as a key to get access to the Ai.

### AI Interface: 
A smart contract will interact with an Ai API. This contract can interact and update the user’s balances to pay for compute.


## Example Use Cases

### Community funded Ai:
Take a network organization as an example. Let’s say there are 2000 participants. When they join they each put 0.1 ether in to a fund that powers an Ai trough ‘yield to compute’. That is 200 eth in a vault generating 10 eth a year as a compute budget to power the community Ai doing community tasks. When any participants leave they reclaim their 0.1 eth back. A time based lock could be applied here.

### Ai applications powered by crypto: 
U can build an application using open source Ai models, decentralized compute and decentralized finance and it will make the application more resistant against interference from outside forces. Especially if the application is governed in a decentralized way. Automation and smart contracts are essential in cutting out central points of failure.

### Ai owning itself: 
What if the access to the Ai model, funds and compute are all relying on a wallet and this Ai has agency over that wallet. In this case the wallet is an erc-6551 NFT. The Ai could be owning itself.

### NFT’s with Ai baked in: 
When an NFT is the only access point to a specific Ai model. That runs on decentralized compute. Funded by decentralized finance. It’s almost as if the Ai is inside the NFT the same way an image is inside an NFT.
